- Give the select() method a CSS selector as input, and it will return a reference to the first element in the DOM that matches. (Use selectAll() when you need more than one element.)
- append() creates whatever new DOM element you specify and appends it to the end (but just inside) of whatever selection it’s acting on.
- Finally, append() hands off a reference to the new element it just created.
- text() takes a string and inserts it between the opening and closing tags of the current selection. (In cases where there is existing content, it will be overwritten.)
