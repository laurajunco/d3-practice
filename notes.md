# Notes

- D3, a JavaScript-based tool for loading data into a web page and generating visuals from that data.

- Visualizing data is the fastest way to communicate it to others.
- Revealing unexpected patterns and trends in the otherwise hidden information around us. At its best, data visualization is expert storytelling.
- Visualization is a process of mapping information to visuals. We craft rules that interpret data and express its values as visual properties

- Dynamic, interactive visualizations can empower people to explore the data for themselves.
- interactivity can also encourage engagement with the data in ways that static images cannot.
- Some visualizations can make exploring data feel more like playing a game. Interactive visualization can be a great medium for engaging an audience who might not otherwise care about the topic or data at hand.

- The more accessible your visualization, the greater your audience and your impact

- Because D3 is written in JavaScript, learning to use D3 often means learning a lot about JavaScript.
